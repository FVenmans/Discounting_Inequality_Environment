This repository allows contains the data and the code for the paper Social discounting, inequality aversion and the Environment", by me and Ben Groom, published in the Journal of Environmental Economics and Management in 2021. The Word file shows the printed sheet the respondents received. The 2 powerpoints are the powerpoints that the group 14 saw (there are 12 powerpoints with slightly different settings). The excell file is the raw numeric version of the answers on paper. These files allow you to understand how the data is coded. Stata do file 1 starts from the excell sheet and makes a few extra varialbes, saved in the stata data file. Finally the dofile 2 does the regression analysis. The maximum likelihood analysis is available on demand.
