This repository contains the data and the code to replicate the results in the paper Social discounting, inequality aversion and the Environment", by me and Ben Groom, published in the Journal of Environmental Economics and Management in 2021. The Word file shows the printed sheet the respondents received. The 2 powerpoints shows the questions for group 14 (there are 12 powerpoints with different combinations of domain, gain, loss, 1 or 2 regions etc.). The excell file is the raw numeric version of the answers on paper for group 14. The column 'Indifference' codes the indifference point (respondents answer 7 to 10 questions to establish the indifference point). These files allow you to understand how the data is structured. Stata do file "1 data preparation" starts from the excell sheets (17 in total) and constructs the database, "ResultsClean2020Compact.dta". Finally the dofile "2 RegressionDiscountRate3" does the regression analysis. The maximum likelihood analysis is available on demand. This analysis uses an 'extended' version of the dataset, where each switching point is decomposed in the 7 to 10 underlinging questions.
